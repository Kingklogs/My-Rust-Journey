# 🏛️ The MEV Protection Guardian
*"Shielding transactions from the sandwich spirits"*

A narrative-driven Rust implementation for protecting DeFi transactions from MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) attacks, built using the Systems Storyteller architecture.

## 📖 The Story

In the dark depths of the blockchain mempool, innocent transactions venture forth seeking to complete their missions. But lurking in the shadows are the dreaded **Shadow Hunters** - MEV bots that prey upon vulnerable transactions through sandwich attacks, frontrunning, and flashloan arbitrage.

When danger approaches, the ancient **Guardian Temple** awakens, weaving protective enchantments around transactions and guiding them to the **Sacred Sanctuary** where they can execute safely, protected from the predatory bots.

## 🎭 Story Structure

### Act I: Threats Emerge (`threats_emerge/`)
- **The Mempool Darkens**: Transactions enter dangerous waters
- **Shadow Hunters Awaken**: MEV bots detect profit opportunities  
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Transaction risks are evaluated

### Act II: Guardians Shield (`guardians_shield/`)
- **Guardian Temple Activation**: Protection systems engage
- **Spell Weaving**: Appropriate defenses are selected
- **Shield Strengthening**: Multi-layered protection is applied

### Act III: Safety Achieved (`safety_achieved/`)
- **Sacred Sanctuary**: Protected execution environment
- **Safe Harbor**: Transaction completes successfully
- **Story Documentation**: Journey is recorded for future reference

## 🛡️ MEV Protection Features

### Threat Detection
- **Sandwich Attack Detection**: Identifies vulnerable swaps
- **Frontrunning Analysis**: Spots time-sensitive transactions
- **Flashloan Monitoring**: Detects arbitrage opportunities
- **Gas Price Analysis**: High gas indicates MEV attractiveness

### Protection Mechanisms
- **Private Mempool Routing**: Hides transactions from public view
- **Sandwich Immunity**: Prevents value extraction through timing
- **Frontrunning Barriers**: Blocks transaction ordering attacks  
- **Flashloan Shields**: Protects against flashloan-based exploits
- **Time Delay Enchantments**: Adds protective delays when needed

### Security Levels
- 🔴 **Vulnerable**: Minimal protection, high risk
- 🟡 **Partially Protected**: Some defenses active
- 🟢 **Fully Shielded**: Comprehensive protection
- 💎 **Sacred Sanctuary**: Maximum security with private execution

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+
- Cargo

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mev-protection-guardian
cargo build --release
```

### Basic Usage
```rust
use mev_protection_guardian::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create a vulnerable transaction
    let transaction = InnocentTransaction {
        id: uuid::Uuid::new_v4(),
        user_address: "0x742d35Cc6064C2532C4a2e3cE4285b8b4f267Db8".to_string(),
        target_contract: "0x7a250d5630B4cF539739dF2C5dAcb4c659F2488D".to_string(),
        value: 100000,
        gas_price: 150,
        data: vec![0x38, 0xed, 0x17, 0x39], // Swap function signature
        vulnerability_score: 0.0,
    };
    
    // Run the complete protection saga
    match complete_mev_protection_saga(transaction).await {
        Ok(sanctuary) => {
            println!("🎉 Transaction protected! Security: {:?}", sanctuary.security_level);
        },
        Err(plot_twist) => {
            println!("⚡ Challenge encountered: {}", plot_twist);
            let resolution = plot_twist.resolve_the_conflict();
            println!("📋 Resolution: {:?}", resolution);
        }
    }
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Running the Demo
```bash
cargo run
```

## 🧪 Testing the Tales

Run the narrative test suite:
```bash
# Run all story tests
cargo test tales

# Run specific story scenarios
cargo test the_happy_ending_saga
cargo test the_plot_twist_recovery
```

### Test Stories Include:
- **The Happy Ending**: Normal protection flow succeeds
- **The Plot Twist Recovery**: Error scenarios and resolution
- **The Unexpected Ending**: Edge cases and unusual situations

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows the **Systems Storyteller** architecture pattern:

```
src/
├── lib.rs                    # Table of Contents & Character Definitions
├── threats_emerge/           # Act I: MEV Detection & Threat Analysis
├── guardians_shield/         # Act II: Protection Logic & Spell Weaving  
├── safety_achieved/          # Act III: Safe Execution & Sanctuary
├── supporting_cast/          # Utilities, Errors, and Logging
└── tales/                    # Tests Written as Narrative Stories
```

### Key Characters
- **InnocentTransaction**: The protagonist seeking safe passage
- **ShadowHunter**: MEV bots that threaten transactions
- **GuardianProtector**: The defensive system that provides protection
- **SafeSanctuary**: The protected environment for execution

### Story Elements
- **ProtectionJourney**: Tracks the narrative arc of each transaction
- **StoryBeat**: Individual events in the protection process
- **PlotTwist**: Errors that become part of the story
- **ProtectionSpell**: The various defensive mechanisms available

## 🔮 Advanced Features

### Dynamic Protection
The system adapts protection strategies based on:
- Transaction value and complexity
- Current mempool conditions
- Detected threat patterns
- Historical attack data

### Story Logging
Complete audit trails capture:
- Threat detection events
- Protection decisions
- Guardian activations
- Sanctuary security levels
- Resolution outcomes

### Extensible Threat Detection
Easy to add new MEV attack patterns:
```rust
// Add new shadow hunter types
pub enum AttackType {
    SandwichAttack,
    Frontrunning,
    YourNewAttackType,  // <- Easy to extend
}
```
